# Product Name: 
Driveweave

# Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a decentralized file-sharing application where users can upload files, and the files are stored securely on the Arweave blockchain. This ensures that the files are immutable, tamper-proof, and permanently accessible.

# Problem Statement:
Traditional file-sharing platforms lack robust security measures, exposing users to data breaches, unauthorized access, and the risk of file corruption. Additionally, the impermanence of data on centralized servers raises concerns about long-term accessibility. Users need a solution that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and enduring availability of their shared files.

# Solution:
Driveweave addresses these challenges by leveraging the Arweave blockchain to create a decentralized file-sharing platform. Through file encryption and storage on the immutable Arweave network, Driveweave guarantees tamper-proof and secure file sharing. Users can confidently share sensitive data, knowing that their files remain accessible forever, resistant to censorship, and free from the vulnerabilities associated with centralized servers.

# Key Components

- **User Interface (UI):** Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload files easily. The UI should display relevant information such as file name, size, and upload progress.

- **Arweave Integration:** Utilize the Arweave SDK or API to interact with the Arweave blockchain. When a user uploads a file, the application generates a transaction that contains the file data and stores it on the Arweave network.

- **File Encryption:** Implement file encryption before uploading it to Arweave to enhance security. This ensures that even if the data is publicly accessible on the Arweave blockchain, it remains confidential to anyone without the proper decryption key.

- **File Retrieval:** Create a mechanism for users to retrieve their uploaded files. This involves querying the Arweave blockchain for the specific transactions related to each file and reconstructing the original file from the retrieved data.

- **Immutable Links:** Generate immutable links for each uploaded file, pointing to its transaction on the Arweave blockchain. These links can be shared with others, providing a way to access the file and verify its authenticity.

- **User Authentication:** Implement a simple user authentication system to track and manage user uploads. This could involve creating user accounts or using wallet addresses to associate files with specific users.

- **Decentralized Storage Management:** Consider decentralized storage management mechanisms to distribute file storage across multiple Arweave nodes, ensuring redundancy and availability.

- **File Metadata:** Include metadata such as file name, upload date, and uploader information within the Arweave transaction. This metadata is crucial for organizing and searching for files on the blockchain.
